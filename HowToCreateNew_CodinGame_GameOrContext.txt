NEW-Automatic Way! :)
1.  When you want to create a new game to code with, execute the Powershell command:
		c:\dev\CodinGame\CreateNewGame.ps1 "{Game/ContestName}"
2.  If you have existing classes you want to add, create/save the file, and add it in the csproj file, as <Compile Include="{ClassName}.cs" />
3.  Update the UsingStatements.cs file, to add in any new Using statements, if applicable.
4.  When you want to combine all classes into a single file, execute the Powershell command:
		c:\dev\CodinGame\CombineToOne.ps1 "{Game/ContestName}" "{NameOfMainProgram}.cs"
